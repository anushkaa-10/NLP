# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Toolkit

Welcome to the NLP Toolkit! This repository contains a collection of tools, models, and scripts designed to make working with natural language data easier and more efficient.

## Features-
Text Preprocessing: Tools for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, and more.
Text Representation: Implementations of popular text representation techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT embeddings.
Machine Learning Models: Pre-trained models and scripts for training your own models on tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), text classification, and machine translation.
Evaluation Metrics: Functions for evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, BLEU score, and ROUGE score.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing text data and model outputs, including word clouds, dependency parses, and attention maps.
